Project Name: Age Quiz

Description:

This Python program takes a user’s age as input and outputs a variety of responses based on the value entered. It uses the if-elif-else conditional structure to determine which message to display based on the age that the user inputs e.g. if the user's inputs an age above 100 the code prints "Sorry you're dead" on the user's screen.
